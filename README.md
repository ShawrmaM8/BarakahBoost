\*\*BarakaBoost\*\* ðŸŒ™âœ¨

A zero-cost, low-maintenance Streamlit app that quantifies spiritual habits (prayer, Qurâ€™an recitation, sadaqah, screen time, sleep, dhikr) into a \*\*daily Baraka Score\*\*.



\* Users log habits directly in-app â†’ stored in JSON.

\* Automated backend computes correlations \& ML insights with pandas + scikit-learn.

\* Interactive dashboard visualizes trends, prayer heatmaps, Qurâ€™an surahs, and digital well-being.

\* Designed for sustainability: seamless UX, transparent scoring, free to deploy on Streamlit Cloud.

Want me to also draft a \*\*GitHub README.md\*\* (with usage, setup, screenshots placeholders, and contribution guide)? That would give the repo a polished, ready-to-publish feel.
